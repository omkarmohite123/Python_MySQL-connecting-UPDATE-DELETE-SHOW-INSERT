Python can be used in database applications.




One of the most popular databases is MySQL.





## MySQL Database ##




To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.





You can download a free MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/






## Install MySQL Driver ##






Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.





In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".





We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".





PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.






## Download and install "MySQL Connector": ##






pip install mysql-connector-python






## Test MySQL Connector ##







Test MySQL Connector





If the above code was executed with no errors, "MySQL Connector" is installed and ready to be used.
